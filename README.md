# VANTAGE 
Is a premium, performance-first digital portfolio designed specifically for the modern videographer and photographer. In an era where content is split between cinematic 16:9 storytelling and high-energy 9:16 vertical social media, VANTAGE bridges the gap with a sophisticated, unified viewing experience.

Built with a "Dark Cinema" aesthetic, the platform acts as a digital gallery that "gets out of the way," allowing the vibrant colors and motion of the visual work to take center stage. Every interaction is engineered to feel like a high-end physical gallery—quiet, luxurious, and focused.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Hybrid Media Engine: A custom-built grid system that seamlessly handles both cinematic wedding films (16:9) and vertical reels/shorts (9:16) without awkward whitespace or layout shifts.

* The "Dark Cinema" UI: A meticulously crafted dark theme using a zinc-950 palette, champagne gold accents, and fluid typography to evoke a premium, "Pro-Studio" feel.

* Intelligent Auto-Play: Utilizes the Intersection Observer API to trigger muted video previews as the user scrolls, creating a "living" portfolio that feels dynamic and responsive.

* The Investment Framework: A tiered service module that frames pricing as a high-value investment, providing clear communication of deliverables and rates.

* Mobile-First "App" Experience: A thumb-optimized navigation system designed for the 80% of clients who will view the portfolio via social media links.

* SEO & Video Schema: Built-in JSON-LD structured data to ensure videos are indexed by search engines, turning a visual portfolio into a lead-generation tool.
